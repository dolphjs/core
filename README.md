### OWL

Owl.js is an express.js library for making software development easier by taking care of all the unneccessary tasks developers have to worry about.
Owl.js makes it possible for junior developers to write code in an environment set-up as if they are senior's. It supports robust codebase system and the best error handling middlewares.
With owl.js code is written smaller as it has many repetitive features taken account of and put into the engine which is then exposed to the developer.
